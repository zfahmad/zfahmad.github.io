<h3>About</h3>
<p style="line-height:1.5">
<!-- <p> -->
I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Alberta working with <a
href="https://movingai.com/index.html">Nathan
Sturtevant</a>. I am passionate about research in artificial intelligence --- my work focuses
on research in machine learning, search, reinforcement learning, games and
planning. I previously received my Ph.D. at the Department of Computing Science at the
University of Alberta. I worked under the co-supervision of <a
href="https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~bowling">Michael Bowling</a> and <a
href="https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~santanad">Levi Lelis</a>. Prior to that, I
completed my Master's at the University of Alberta under the supervision of
Robert Holte. I received my Bachelor's of Sciences and Engineering at the
Islamic University of Technology in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
