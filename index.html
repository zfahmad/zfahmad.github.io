<h3>About Me</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;line-height:1.5">
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computing Science at the
University of Alberta. I am working in the Computer Curling
Research Group under the co-supervision of <a href="https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~bowling">Michael Bowling</a>
and <a href="https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~santanad">Levi Lelis</a>. I previously completed
my Master's at
the University of Alberta under the supervision of Robert Holte. I received my
Bachelor's of Sciences and Engineering at the Islamic University of Technology
in Dhaka, Bangladesh. My interests in research mainly reside in areas of
Artificial Intelligence including Machine Learning and Search.
